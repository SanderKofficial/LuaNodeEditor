<b>Lua Node Editor</b> is a powerfull visual scripting tool that uses nodes to program visually by using it with the lua programming language. This tool is build originally to be used for the KZX Engine, however as it is also a powerfull tool to be used for other projects we decided to share the tool to github as an individual project.
